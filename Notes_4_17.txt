Notes 4/17/18

Multiple gt histograms - run comparison w each gt then if any match it's fish 

if multiple boxes within certain radius - draw one box  
(coords) --> cluster them into 1 rect 


arr = {}
for x in xs:
    arr[x.index] = x

B = [x,y,x2,y2]
for k in range (0, len(B))
    newx, newy = B[k], B[k+1] 
    for loop: (thru B again) 
        loop thru rest and calc distance 
        if others @ location, delete 

print dimensions of tinyfish - MAKE SURE DIVISIBLE BY 8 
convert image to grayscale 

histogram of gradient 
(partials / kernel over image) 
slide kernel over image 
edge direction is arctan of k1/k2
histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) 
xSobel and ySobel spatial gradient (Vector derivative)

Trying to find dir of edge then take histogram of edges 

TO DO
look @ histograms of all boxes in 0.8 intersection
